## Tech demo 2

Hello. This is group Star. We have a tech presentation on XAMARIN, which is used in our capstone project.

The problem we all face today as a programmer is transferring our product or code from one platform to another. Such as if we compiled a project written in C in Linux environment, it is very difficult for programmer to move the project to win10 or mac. And some project such as games need a huge library to support it. The cross-platform is the issue.

The solution for our problem in the capstone is Xamarin. Our costumer needs both IOS and android app. But after our consideration, we think C# is the key tool for this, because most of our group members have ability to using C# and Java (Java and C# is the same thing, you know), but no swift. The solution for transferring our code from C# to swift is Xamarin - a tool owned by Microsoft that programmers can use for doing cross-platform developing.

Xamarin is a visual studio tool which can deliver native win/android/ios apps to each others. It can shared C# user interface code and app logic across multiple platforms. Nowadays, over 1.4 million developers were using Xamarin's products in 120 countries around the world.

The advantages of using Xamarin are: native user interfaces included same UI in different platform. Users do not learn how to use the app again and again. And Native API access. The app using Xamarin can us specific api. A great achievement for developers. And it also can use the hardware acceleration.

The app can scan information and sent it to the company's database. The code is actually easy, only 200 lines of C# code. But if we do not have Xamarin, we may need to do for both IOS and Android apps, in which we need to learn swift, and write code for both swift and Java.
